I am a first year PhD student funded by the [Medical Research Council](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/multisci-mrc-dtp/), specialising in Artificial Intelligence and Computational Neuroscience.

My research interests focus in building top-down and bottom-up computational models of the brain to better understand and treat different neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s). I am interested in working on research projects that cross the boundaries between artificial intelligence (AI) and the clinics, with the aim of making AI actually applicable in clinical practice. I work on data-centric and explainable AI, with a special interest towards graph machine learning. 

I enjoy teaching, both inside and [outside](https://girlswhoml.com/) academic environments.
You can check out a detailed list in my [Teaching page](/teaching.qmd).
