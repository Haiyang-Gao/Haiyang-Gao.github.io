I am a final-year undergraduate student at the Hongyi Honor College, Wuhan University, majoring in Mathematical Finance. In the 2024–2025 academic year, I studied Sports Management and Business Analytics under the supervision of Dr. Lorena Martin at the University of Southern California. In the summer of 2025, I attended the Yale Summer Session, where I took courses in Game Theory and Data Science.

My academic training has given me a broad foundation in microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, behavioral economics, game theory, market equilibrium theory, statistics, stochastic analysis, numerical analysis, and data science. I am particularly interested in leveraging data science techniques — including machine learning and natural language processing — together with financial theory to rigorously investigate the degree of market rationality in China, a topic I believe is underexplored but of great importance for improving the market environment. In addition, inspired by Dr. Martin’s course and my own passion for badminton, I aim to conduct interdisciplinary research at the intersection of data science and sports, with a focus on injury prevention, career longevity, and competition scheduling optimization in professional badminton. My long-term goal is to provide evidence-based recommendations for organizations such as the Badminton World Federation (BWF) to balance athlete health with audience engagement.

I have served as a teaching assistant for a Game Theory course (2024–2025), published the 2024 Annual Report on China’s Green Credit Market in Modern Commercial Bank (2025), and participated in seminar discussions on industrial organization theory in Professor Bo Shen’s research group.
