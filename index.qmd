I am a PhD candidate for the [MRC MultiSci Program](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/multisci-mrc-dtp/) specialising in Artificial Intelligence and Computational Neuroscience.

I am a multidisciplinary researcher with broad interests. 
I started my academic career in bioinformatics, but since then I have delved in the fields
of pyschobiology, social science, digital pathology, computational neuroscience, and more recently graph machine learning.

I enjoy teaching, both inside and [outside](https://girlswhoml.com/) academic environments.
You can check out a detailed list in my [Teaching page](/teaching.qmd).
