    "text": "I am a PhD candidate for the MRC MultiSci Program specialising in Artificial Intelligence and Computational Neuroscience.\nI am a multidisciplinary researcher with broad interests. I started my academic career in bioinformatics, but since then I have delved in the fields of pyschobiology, social science, digital pathology, computational neuroscience, and more recently graph machine learning.\nI enjoy teaching, both inside and outside academic environments. You can check out a detailed list in my Teaching page.\n\nFurther links"

    "text": "Imperial College Data Science Society\n\n\n 🔗 Event page\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) provides powerful tools that can be applied in many different fields and that are capable of solving complex problems, even beyond what we could have imagined many years ago. In biomedical research, AI algorithms can be used to reach diagnosis, predict disease progression and patients’ survival, recommend patients’ treatments and much more, which is all fascinating. But the question is: will these algorithms be ever applied in clinical practice and, in turn, improve people lives?"

    "text": "November - December | 🔗 Materials\n(Ongoing)\nInteractive workshops on a variety of topics in Biomedical Data Science for the MRes Biomedical Research from Imperial College London.\nTopics covered so far: Model Validation and Performance & Univariate Statistics.\n\n\n\nNovember | 🔗 Materials I designed the learning materials and assisted in the teaching of all workshops. Generally speaking, the content included hands-on training in data cleaning, pre-processing and wrangling and applied statistical techniques (i.e. Regression, ANOVA). More specifically to brain sciences, I designed materials for analysing structural and functional MRI data (i.e. volumetric measures, resting-state, task-fMRI and graph theory). Other more advanced workshops that I also created involved hands-on introduction to supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning and NLP. All workshops materials were shared as Jupyter notebooks.\n\n\n\nOctober | 🔗 Materials\nCoding pre-material of the MSc Translational Neuroscience at Imperial College London. It is an introduction to programming in Python and statistics, aimed to provide students the necessary foundation to smooothly complete the programming modules that the course offers and to bridge the gap between students with low and high coding literacy. It contains introductory Jupyter notebooks on all-things Python, including functions, loops, arrays, strings, lists, dictionaries, dataframes, basic statistics (i.e. correlations, t-tests, linear regressions, non-parametric tests) and plotting (both seaborn and matplotlib)."

The DS helper team, which is a student-led activity organised within the MRes in Biomedical Research, is here to help you. The project is characterised by different forms of peer-to-peer learning, whose aim is to create an open, friendly, instructive environment where students can reach out in case of issues with data science related topics and can learn some data science if interested.\nRead more"
