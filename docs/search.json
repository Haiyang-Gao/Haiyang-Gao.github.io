    "text": "2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInspiring Women in Data\n\nA group of people from QuantumBlack invited us as speakers to a Data Engineering meetup event. My colleague Hajer Karoui and I gave a talk to on using multimodal data to establish the best predictors of Alzheimer’s progression, and discussed more broadly the potential and limitations of AI, and of its applicability in clinical practice.\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImperial College Data Science Society\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) provides powerful tools that can be applied in many different fields and that are capable of solving complex problems, even beyond what we could have imagined many years ago. In biomedical research, AI algorithms can be used to reach diagnosis, predict disease progression and patients’ survival, recommend patients’ treatments and much more, which is all fascinating. But the question is: will these algorithms be ever applied in clinical practice and, in turn, improve people lives?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworking event\n\nThe goal of the event was to present the research conducted at Imperial College London to current and incoming students (undergraduates and masters). This event aims to inspire students in their career path in academia and related fields and in their choice of PhD topics, and to introduce them to potential research that can be completed while being at Imperial.\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Don’t f**k the algorithm: how to develop trustworthy AI”\n\nHosted by the Section of Bioinformatics (Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction) on MS Teams (see Livestream link), this session is chaired by Dr Joram Posma.\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEDx Heidelberg 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICT Days: orizzonti 2016"

Generally speaking, the content included hands-on training in data cleaning, pre-processing and wrangling and applied statistical techniques (i.e. Regression, ANOVA). More specifically to brain sciences, I designed materials for analysing structural and functional MRI data (i.e. volumetric measures, resting-state, task-fMRI and graph theory). Other more advanced workshops that I also created involved hands-on introduction to supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning and NLP. All workshops materials were shared as Jupyter notebooks.\n\n\n\nOctober | 🔗 Materials\nCoding pre-material of the MSc Translational Neuroscience at Imperial College London. It is an introduction to programming in Python and statistics, aimed to provide students the necessary foundation to smooothly complete the programming modules that the course offers and to bridge the gap between students with low and high coding literacy. It contains introductory Jupyter notebooks on all-things Python, including functions, loops, arrays, strings, lists, dictionaries, dataframes, basic statistics (i.e. correlations, t-tests, linear regressions, non-parametric tests) and plotting (both seaborn and matplotlib)."

The DS helper team, which is a student-led activity organised within the MRes in Biomedical Research, is here to help you. The project is characterised by different forms of peer-to-peer learning, whose aim is to create an open, friendly, instructive environment where students can reach out in case of issues with data science related topics and can learn some data science if interested.\nRead more"
