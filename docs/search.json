    "text": "I am a first year PhD student funded by the Medical Research Council, specialising in Artificial Intelligence and Computational Neuroscience.\nMy research interests focus on building top-down and bottom-up computational models of the brain to better understand and treat different neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s). I am interested in working on research projects that cross the boundaries between artificial intelligence (AI) and the clinics, with the aim of making AI actually applicable in clinical practice. I work on data-centric and explainable AI, with a special interest towards graph machine learning.\nI enjoy teaching, both inside and outside academic environments. You can check out a detailed list in my Teaching page.\n\nKey topics\n\nComputational Modelling\nMachine Learning\nExplainable AI\nGraph ML\nCognitive Neuroscience\n\n\n\nEducation\n\nMRes Biomedical Research (Data Science) - Imperial College London\nMA Health Humanities - UCL\nBSc Molecular Biotechnology - Heidelberg University\n\n\n\nFurther links"

    "text": "Networking event\n\n2021-09\nThe goal of the event was to present the research conducted at Imperial College London to current and incoming students (undergraduates and masters). This event aims to inspire students in their career path in academia and related fields and in their choice of PhD topics, and to introduce them to potential research that can be completed while being at Imperial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Science Helper Team\n\n2020-09 – 2021-06\nI organised the data science helper team with the aim to helps students with data science related questions. The activity consisted of lectures, a discussion forum and clinic sessions, where students could get in touch with research project’s specific questions. More details in the teaching tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEDx UniHeidelberg\n\n2018-06\nTED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. The main theme of the event was “doubt and dare”. Specifically, to doubt not only the opinions of others, but also their own, to try to look at things differently and consider other people’s opinions."

I gave a talk on how to use multimodal data to establish the best predictors of Alzheimer’s progression, and discussed more broadly the potential and limitations of AI, and of its applicability in clinical practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImperial College Data Science Society\n\n2021-11\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) provides powerful tools that can be applied in many different fields and that are capable of solving complex problems, even beyond what we could have imagined many years ago. In biomedical research, AI algorithms can be used to reach diagnosis, predict disease progression and patients’ survival, recommend patients’ treatments and much more, which is all fascinating. But the question is: will these algorithms be ever applied in clinical practice and, in turn, improve people lives?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychobiology: looking at the bigger picture\n\n2020-11\nThe aim of the talk was to describe the potential of interdisciplinary research that crosses the boundaries of social and biological sciences, with a special focus on the field of psychobiology"

Generally speaking, the content included hands-on training in data cleaning, pre-processing and wrangling and applied statistical techniques (i.e. Regression, ANOVA). More specifically to brain sciences, I designed materials for analysing structural and functional MRI data (i.e. volumetric measures, resting-state, task-fMRI and graph theory). Other more advanced workshops that I also created involved hands-on introduction to supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning and NLP. All workshops materials were shared as Jupyter notebooks.\n\n\n\nOctober 22 | Master’s | 🔗 Materials\n\n\nPython\n\n\nCoding pre-material of the MSc Translational Neuroscience at Imperial College London. It is an introduction to programming in Python and statistics, aimed to provide students the necessary foundation to smooothly complete the programming modules that the course offers and to bridge the gap between students with low and high coding literacy. It contains introductory Jupyter notebooks on all-things Python, including functions, loops, arrays, strings, lists, dictionaries, dataframes, basic statistics (i.e. correlations, t-tests, linear regressions, non-parametric tests) and plotting (both seaborn and matplotlib)."
