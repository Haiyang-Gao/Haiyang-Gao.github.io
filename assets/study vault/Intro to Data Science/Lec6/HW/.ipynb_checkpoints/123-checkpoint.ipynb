    "For our first set of exercises, let's practice using for loops! \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to explore for loops, let's look again at the American Community Survey (ACS) data. The code below loads a sample of the ACS data as a pandas DataFrame and then extracts three *lists* from DataFrame using the `to_list()` method. The three lists that are extracted are:\n",

    "- `sex`: contains the sex for each of the 10,000 randomly selected participants\n",

    "These Python lists are in order, so that, for example, the first item of the `earned_incomes` list comes from the same person as the first item in the `sex` list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For part 1 of this homework (i.e., the questions about for loops), you are not allowed to use any functions in the NumPy package. Also, throughout the homework, you are not allowed to use any pandas functions (apart from the code that loads the data that is written for you). Hopefully, this will make you appreciate the usefulness of the NumPy and pandas packages and also give you some insight into how the functions in these packages were written! "

    "**Question 3.1 (8 points)**. In order to get the distance between two geographic locations (such as a La Quinta hotel and Denny's restaurant), we need a function that can compute spatial distances. While the Euclidean distance function we created above is good for calculating distances on a flat plane, the Earth is round and thus the Euclidean distance is not an appropriate measure to use (although some people would disagree and say the [earth is flat](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8132700/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate the distance between longitude and latitude coordinates on a sphere, we can use the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula).  Let's write a function called `haversine_dist(long1, lat1, long2, lat2, precision = 3)` which takes in two geographic coordinates `(long1, lat1)` and `(long2, lat2)` and calculates the geographical distance between the points using the Haversine formula. Your function should do the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert all the longitude and latitude coordinates into radians by multiplying the original coordinates by $\\pi/180$. In your function, you can do this multiplication and then save the results back into the original argument names of `long1`, `lat1`, `long2`, `lat2`. *Hint: `math.pi` could be useful here.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate a value `a` using the formula:  $a ~ = ~ sin^2((lat_2 - lat_1)/2) + cos(lat_1) \\cdot cos(lat_2) \\cdot sin^2((long_2 - long_1)/2)$. *Note: that $sin^2$ is the value you get by taking the sine of an number and then squaring the results. The functions `np.sin()`, `np.cos()` and `np.arcsin()` will be useful for this problem (be sure to use these NumPy rather than functions from other modules).* \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate the distance in kilometers using the formula: $d = R \\cdot 2 \\cdot arcsin(\\sqrt{a})$, where R is the radius of the Earth in kilometers and is equal to a value of 6371.\n",

    "4. Convert the distance from kilometers to miles by multiplying the distance in kilometers by the constant 0.621371.\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. Return the results rounded to the number of decimal places specified by the `precision` argument (which should have a default value of 3, as already specified in the function arguments).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have written the function use the test code below to print the distance between the first La Quinta and the first Denny's (by first La Quinta, we mean the La Quinta at index 0). The code also prints out the addresses of these locations which you will use in the next question. \n"
