`2021-09`

The goal of the event was to present the research conducted at Imperial College London to current and incoming students (undergraduates and masters). This event aims to inspire students in their career path in academia and related fields and in their choice of PhD topics, and to introduce them to potential research that can be completed while being at Imperial.

TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. The main theme of the event was "doubt and dare". Specifically, to doubt not only the opinions of others, but also their own, to try to look at things differently and consider other peopleâ€™s opinions.

`2022-03`

QuantumBlack invited me as speakers for a Data Engineering meetup event. I gave a talk on how to use multimodal data to establish the best predictors of Alzheimerâ€™s progression, and discussed more broadly the potential and limitations of AI, and of its applicability in clinical practice.

`2021-11`

Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides powerful tools that can be applied in many different fields and that are capable of solving complex problems, even beyond what we could have imagined many years ago. In biomedical research, AI algorithms can be used to reach diagnosis, predict disease progression and patientsâ€™ survival, recommend patientsâ€™ treatments and much more, which is all fascinating. But the question is: will these algorithms be ever applied in clinical practice and, in turn, improve people lives?
