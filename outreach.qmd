A group of people from [QuantumBlack](https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/overview/alliances-and-acquisitions/quantumblack)
invited us as speakers to a Data Engineering meetup event.
My colleague Hajer Karoui and I gave a talk to on using multimodal data to establish the best predictors of Alzheimerâ€™s progression, and discussed more broadly the potential and limitations of AI, and of its applicability in clinical practice.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides powerful tools that can be applied in many different fields and that are capable of solving complex problems, even beyond what we could have imagined many years ago. In biomedical research, AI algorithms can be used to reach diagnosis, predict disease progression and patientsâ€™ survival, recommend patientsâ€™ treatments and much more, which is all fascinating. But the question is: will these algorithms be ever applied in clinical practice and, in turn, improve people lives?
